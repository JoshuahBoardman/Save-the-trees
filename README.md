# Save The Trees

## Description
    This is a static site about saving trees from deforestation.
## Motive
    I noticed I had been working on many apps but had not built many websites. I took the opportunity to improve my mobile-first development skill.
## What I Learned
    I learned how to build apps using mobile-first design and improved my responsive design skills.
